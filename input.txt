 Nevyana DELHOMME 
 👨 💻 Technology: I previously graduated from Toulouse Business School, top-ranked French Business School, with a Master 2 in Finance and Strategy. I gained exposure to data collection, quantitative analysis and results interpretation.

I'd like to work as an Operations or Product Manager, an hybrid position between tech, management and business. The value I brought would be a huge ambition for the product, a deep empathy for our target customers, my understanding of both business and technology, my ability to prioritize and to get things done.

Dynamic, hard working and determined I am highly adaptable, and easy to work with. Known for my team spirit and drive, I will be an enthusiastic and dedicated team member. My educational background and previous work experiences in consulting and finance and most recently in coding have provided me with strong analytical skills, a sharp eye for details and have strengthened my natural eagerness to learn and improve my skillset.  I have worked in many different cities in the USA, Mexico, Singapore, Spain… giving me the ability to work with many different types of people and culture.
